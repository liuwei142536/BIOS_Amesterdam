Routine Description:

  This function will connect all current system handles recursively. The
  connection will finish until every handle's child handle created if it have.

Arguments:

  None

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS          - All handles and it's child handle have been connected

  EFI_STATUS           - Return the status of gBS->LocateHandleBuffer().
