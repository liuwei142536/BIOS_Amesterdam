  Interface structure for the SMM IO trap pause and resume protocol
  This protocol provides the functions to runtime control the IoTrap SMI enabled/disable.
  This applys the capability to the DispatchHandle which returned by IoTrap callback
  registration, and the DispatchHandle which must be MergeDisable = TRUE and Address != 0.
  Besides, when S3 resuem, it only restores the state of IoTrap callback registration.
  The Paused/Resume state won't be restored after S3 resume.
