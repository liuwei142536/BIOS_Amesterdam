Routine Description:

  Waits for at least the given number of microseconds.

Arguments:

  PeiServices     General purpose services available to every PEIM.
  This            PPI instance structure.
  Microseconds    Desired length of time to wait.

Returns: 

  EFI_SUCCESS     If the desired amount of time was passed.
