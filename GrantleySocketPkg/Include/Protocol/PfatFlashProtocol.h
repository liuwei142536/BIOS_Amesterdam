/**
  This service will write PFAT_DIRECTORY MSR and invoke the PFAT Module by writing to PLAT_FRMW_PROT_TRIGGER MSR for writing/erasing to flash.
  BIOS should invoke PFAT_PROTOCOL.Write() or PFAT_PROTOCOL.Erase() function prior to calling PFAT_PROTOCOL.Execute() for flash writes/erases (except for BiosUpdate).
  Write()/Erase() function will render PFAT script during execution.
  Execute() function will implement the following steps:
  1. Update PFAT directory with address of PUP.
  2. All the AP's except the master thread are put to sleep.
  3. PFAT module is invoked from BSP to execute desired operation.
  If BiosUpdate flag is set to true, PUP (PUP Header + PFAT Script + Update data) is part of data that is passed to SMI Handler. SMI Handler invokes PFAT module to process the update.
  This function would be called by runtime driver, please do not use any MMIO macro here.
