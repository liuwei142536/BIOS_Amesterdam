  A developer supplied function to perform platform specific operations.

  It's a developer supplied function to perform any operations appropriate to a
  given platform. It's invoked just before passing control to PEI core by SEC
  core. Platform developer may modify the SecCoreData and PPI list that is
  passed to PEI Core. 

  @param  SecCoreData           The same parameter as passing to PEI core. It
                                could be overridden by this function.
  @param  PpiList               The default PPI list passed from generic SEC
                                part.

  @return The final PPI list that platform wishes to passed to PEI core.
